      <p>You begin </p>
    <p>a brand new life.</p>
<p>Friends and family </p>
    <p>give their gifts</p>
<p>To joyful husband, </p>
    <p>blissful wife.</p>
      </div>
      <p>But the greatest gift you'll ever get,
A gift from heaven above,
Is love forever, ending never,
Everlasting love..
You'll share 
life's joy and pleasure;
You'll have
plenty of that, it's true.
But love is
the real treasure
For your 
new spouse and you.
And if life hands you challenges,
As it does to one and all,
Your love will hold you steady
And never let you fall.
 Your wedding day is full of joy;
Tomorrow you cannot see.
But one thing's sure for the two of you:
The best is yet to be.</p>
