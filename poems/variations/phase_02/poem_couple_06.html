<h1>Poem for Marriage Couples</h1>
      
      <ul>
<li id="weight">IN YOUR JOYFUL WEDDING DAY</li>
<li>BUT THE GRATEST GIFT</li>
<li id="weight">YOU WILL SHARE LIFE'S JOY</li>
<li>IF LIFE HANDS YOU CHALLENGES</li>
<li id="weight">YOUR WEDDING DAY</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Best Is Yet To Be</h2>

<p id="color">On your joyful wedding day,
    <br><br>
You begin a brand new life.
    <br><br>
Friends and family give their gifts
    <br><br>
To joyful husband, blissful wife.</p>

<p id="weight">But the greatest gift you'll ever get,
    <br><br>
A gift from heaven above,
    <br><br>
Is love forever, ending never,
    <br><br>
Everlasting love..</p>
      <br><br><br><br>
      
<p id="color">You'll share life's joy and pleasure;
    <br><br>
You'll have plenty of that, it's true.
    <br><br>
But love is the real treasure
    <br><br>
For your new spouse and you.</p>
      <br><br><br><br>
      
<p id="weight">And if life hands you challenges,
As it does to one and all,
Your love will hold you steady
And never let you fall.</p>
      
<p id="color"><strong>Your wedding day is full of joy;</strong>
Tomorrow you cannot see.
But one thing's sure for <em>the two of you:</em>
The best is yet to be.</p>
