<h1>Poem for Marriage Couples</h1>

<h2>The Best Is Yet To Be</h2>

<p>On your joyful wedding day,
You begin a brand new life.
Friends and family give their gifts
To joyful husband, blissful wife.</p>

<p id="color">But the greatest gift you'll ever get,
A gift from heaven above,
Is love forever, ending never,
Everlasting love..</p>
      
<p>You'll share life's joy and pleasure;
You'll have plenty of that, it's true.
But love is the real treasure
For your new spouse and you.</p>
      
<p id="color">And if life hands you challenges,
As it does to one and all,
Your love will hold you steady
And never let you fall.</p>
      
<p><strong>Your wedding day is full of joy;</strong>
Tomorrow you cannot see.
But one thing's sure for <em>the two of you:</em>
The best is yet to be.</p>
